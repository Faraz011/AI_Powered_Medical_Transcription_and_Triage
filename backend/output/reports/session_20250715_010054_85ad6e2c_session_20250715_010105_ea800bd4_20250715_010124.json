    "text": " Hi Doctor, I've been feeling really unwell lately. It started a few days ago with the slight fever and chills, but now I'm also experiencing shortness of breath and tightness in my chest. I have a history of hypertension and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about three years ago. I'm currently taking metformin and insulin. Last night, I had a mild chest pain that lasted around 15 minutes. It wasn't sharp, but it was uncomfortable. I also felt very dizzy after standing up suddenly this morning.",
